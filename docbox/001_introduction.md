# Introduction

## What is Arches?

Arches is a web-based, geospatial information system for cultural heritage inventory and management. The platform is purpose-built for the international cultural heritage field, and it is designed to record all types of immovable heritage, including archaeological sites, buildings and other historic structures, landscapes, and heritage ensembles or districts.

Arches allows administrators to create their own database schema, and manage their own thesauri, while end users can search, explore and download the resources directly. In this way Arches is not only a robust and easy to use inventory system, it is also a perfect way to publish and disseminate your organization's cultural heritage information. 

To try Arches out, you can [view the v4 demo](http://dev.archesproject.org) installation, go to the [Arches project page](http://archesproject.org/) for more background, or join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/archesproject) to engage with the active Arches community.
